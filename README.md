# Polymer, meet Electron

This is a starter kit that marries the Polymer framework with the Electron
application shell.

This is a match made in heaven because the developer can use all of the latest
cutting-edge browser features like native ES6 support, HTTP2, and CSS3 
variables, without having to worry about legacy browser support. This makes it
much easier to write forward-leaning web code with Polymer without the need 
for bundling or pre-processors.
